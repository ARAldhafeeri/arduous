# About the tool 

Open-sourced, Real-time  AI powered logging tool for hardware, network, resources utilization for Linux  OS based  machines. Arduous learns about the host  by a set,  configurable period;  By feeding pattern-based NLP Artificial intelligence with the logs in stated learning period " simulative normal activities ". The objective once Arduous is mature and learned enough about root behavior and hosted machine the A.I should alert root user when there is unusual activity via admin-portal and email notification. The alert can be as simple as very high temperature, almost full resources utilization or as complex as detecting uninvited guests activities via nothing but logs.
